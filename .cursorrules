# Cursor Performance Optimization Rules

# File reading optimizations
- Use read_file with specific line ranges when possible
- Avoid reading entire large files unless necessary
- Use grep_search for exact text matches instead of semantic search
- Use file_search for finding files by name
- Only use codebase_search when semantic understanding is needed

# Directory exclusions
- Exclude build directories, node_modules, and large generated files
- Exclude test files and mock files unless specifically needed
- Exclude platform-specific build artifacts

# Search optimizations
- Break complex queries into multiple simple searches
- Target specific directories when possible
- Use exact text matching over semantic search when appropriate

# Memory management
- Limit file reading to 250 lines at a time
- Avoid reading entire large files
- Use targeted searches instead of broad scans

# Performance guidelines
- Always check terminal output after running commands
- Use specific file paths when possible
- Avoid reading files that are excluded by .cursorignore
- Prefer fast text-based searches over semantic searches
